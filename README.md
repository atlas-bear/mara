MARA is a powerful platform designed to provide comprehensive insights into maritime- and other security-related incidents worldwide. This introduction will provide you with an overview of MARA's core features, its purpose, and its primary objectives.

### Purpose and Objectives

#### Purpose

MARA was created to address the critical need for a centralized and reliable source of information related to maritime and other types of security-related incidents. In an increasingly interconnected world, the safety and security of maritime activities are of paramount importance. MARA aims to enhance situational awareness, support decision-making processes, and enable stakeholders to proactively respond to incidents.

2. **Strategic Intelligence Collection**: Our platform aggregates strategic intelligence from various sources, providing valuable insights into specific regions and domains, including maritime, cyber, critical minerals, and more.
3. **Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)**: MARA helps users create and manage Priority Intelligence Requirements, enabling focused analysis and notifications on critical topics.
4. **The 3R Framework (Routes, Resources, Relations)**: We integrate the 3R framework to allow for a holistic understanding of incidents and their implications on global security.
5. **Efficient Data Entry**: MARA simplifies the process of adding content to the platform, ensuring that users can contribute their findings and expertise to enhance the collective knowledge base.
6. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: We follow rigorous SOPs to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, ensuring the trustworthiness of the information presented.

Atlas|Bear is committed to providing a cutting-edge platform for all users, from analysts and decision-makers to organizations concerned with maritime and security affairs.
