# AI Integration

MARA leverages advanced AI capabilities to enhance maritime security data processing, analysis, and reporting. This section covers the AI integration within the system, with a particular focus on the centralized prompts system.

## Features

- **Automated Incident Enhancement**: Standardizes and enhances incident descriptions using AI
- **Security Analysis**: Generates insightful analysis of maritime incidents
- **Recommendations**: Provides actionable recommendations for vessels
- **Weekly Forecasting**: Creates regional maritime security forecasts
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts structured data from unstructured incident reports

## Architecture Overview

The AI integration is built around a centralized prompts system that standardizes interactions with large language models (LLMs). This architecture ensures consistency, maintainability, and flexibility across all AI-powered features.
